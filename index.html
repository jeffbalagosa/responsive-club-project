              The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
              iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is
              he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak
              through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's
              keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down
              upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would
              attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My
              name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

              Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's
              called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make
              shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're
              going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become
              television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in
              one of the ones that became nothing.

              Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake!
              It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the
              arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero.
              And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known
              way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They
              called me Mr Glass.

              Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic
              tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a
              little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting
              outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put
              quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And
              you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping
              for an infant named Jeb.

              Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
              bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I
              do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the
              exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get
              some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are
              connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite
              ends.

              You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it
              has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste
              for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out.
              Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know
              that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out.
              Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it
              was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
              lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

              period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't
